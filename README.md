# StrangePerception

A Strange Perception is the Mixed Reality-Application I did for my intership into CARE Lab (Cybernetics and Reality Engineering).

This application works with the HTC Vive Pro and SteamVR.

What is it ?

It's an application to paint in the real world. With the HTC and your controllers, you can :
    -draw lines (and choose their color)
    -create cube or sphere
    -erase them
    -cut them in two different parts
    -move them
    
How to use it ?

-Open Unity (not working with the 2018.2.13f1 but fine with the 2018.2.8f1)
-add this package to a new project
-add this version of Steam VR : https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases/tag/1.2.3
-download HTC Vive Pro SDK : https://developer.vive.com/resources/knowledgebase/vive-srworks-sdk/
-add the two packages (plugin & Experience) to the projet
-In Unity, go to ProjectAsset => Scenes and open Project

It's done, you just have to start !
